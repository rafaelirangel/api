Why do animals choose to use this area and what makes it so important to them?  Several species of raptors nest in the Chimney Rock area.  What species are these and where do they nest?   Lynx once roamed the surrounding wilderness.  Can you still find lynx in Colorado and if so, why or why not?  The last grizzly bears in Colorado were killed within sight of Chimney Rock.  The last grizzly succumbed in a battle of life and death between one man and the bear.  What happened, and was she indeed the last?  If these questions arouse a desire to learn more, join us on this 1.5-hour tour.  Stories will be recounted that provide answers to these questions and other narratives of wildlife explored.  We’ll travel through some of these animals’ habitats and learn more about what animals need to survive.  Bring binoculars in the event that we’re lucky enough to see some of these fascinating creatures! The tour requires negotiation of a steep, rough trail with exposure to heights and drop-offs.",
